#Inspiration
Our inspiration for creating this project was the increasing number of stray dogs around us!!

#How we build it
This project was made by using basic html5, css3 along with javascript and it's libraies. 

#Challenges faced
Integrating the website along with hosting domain, was one of the challenges we faced.We did run into a couple of hurdles, but they did not stop us from creating this website.

#What we learned

Being a first-timer I got to experience how a hackathon and github works. Also got to explore on various open source technologies.

#Abhiram
Got to experience a perfect hackathon. There were a lot of takeaways from this event. Got to learn about the various libraries associated with javascript and how strong the language is.

#Mainak
Got to learn about node.js and how to work with the google cloud platform and various cloud services. Learnt how hackathons work.

#Atharv
Learnt how hackathons work in general because of major league hacking.

#Future of the website
